# ML-A3
Image text classification

## Installation steps
1. Clone this repository
2. In the parent directory ML-A3 create a new folder and name it data
3. Use the data folder to place all the training and test CSV files from Kaggle
4. To make dev easier, copy the first couple of lines of the training set and paste them to a new file that you would call temp.csv and place it in the data folder. This way you don't have to load the whole training set every time you run your program in dev.
